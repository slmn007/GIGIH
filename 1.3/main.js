// Use JavaScript to fetch data from Spotify API and populate sections dynamically
// This example assumes you have knowledge of making API requests and handling responses
// You would need to implement the API integration yourself

// Example API request to fetch featured playlists
fetch("https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/featured")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    const featuredPlaylistsSection =
      document.getElementById("featured-playlists");
    const playlists = data.items;

    playlists.forEach((playlist) => {
      const playlistDiv = document.createElement("div");
      // Create the playlist HTML dynamically using the playlist data
      // Append the playlistDiv to the featuredPlaylistsSection
      featuredPlaylistsSection.appendChild(playlistDiv);
    });
  })
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));

// Similar API requests can be made for other sections like Discover Weekly and Release Radar
// Handle the response data and populate the respective sections dynamically
